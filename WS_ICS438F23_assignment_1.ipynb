    "## PART 1:  Manipulating JSON Data from Food Fact Database to Extract Key Information\n",
    "\n",
    "This assignment focuses on handling a large dataset from the [Open Food Facts database](https://world.openfoodfacts.org/), which describes itself as:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "[...] a food products database made by everyone, for everyone. You can use it to make better food choices, and as it is open data, anyone can re-use it for any purpose.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This first assignment is not heavy on analytics. Instead, it is designed to give you a taste of the challenges that come with handling large data files â€” long download times, limited storage, and slow data processing. While these inconveniences are minor in this assignment, they are just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to real-world big data analytics tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Our dataset, which can be obtained [here](https://static.openfoodfacts.org/data/openfoodfacts-products.jsonl.gz), consists of a JSONL file, which contains 3 million products, each with hundreds or even thousands of fields.  For example, you can refer to the data of one such product from the URL [here](https://world.openfoodfacts.org/api/v0/product/5060292302201.json), which contians 1304 fields.\n",
    "\n",
    "We are only interested in top 5 ingredients used in each of the products. Therefore, the primary objective is to parse each JSONL object and extract specific fields of interest: the product code, its description, and the details of its five most prevalent ingredients. You will then save this filtered information in a TSV (Tab-Separated Values) file.\n",

    "### Relevance to Big Data Analytics\n",
    "\n",
    "Though this assignment might not involve high-level data science techniques, it's fundamentally crucial for big data analytics. It teaches you how to handle, manipulate, and filter large datasets, which are essential skills you'll need before moving on to more complex operations in analytics.\n",

    "## Working with a Sample Product: How to Extract Fields of Interest\n",
    "\n",
    "To give you a hands-on example, let's look at a sample product and see how to extract the fields we care about.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Downloading the Sample Product Data:**  \n",
    "\tStart by downloading the JSON file for a specific product using the `wget` command.  \n",
    "\t```bash\n",
    "\t\t!wget https://world.openfoodfacts.org/api/v0/product/5060292302201.json\n",
    "\t```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Reading the Product Info:**  \n",
    "\tNext, use Python's `json` library to read this file.  \n",
    "\t```python\n",
    "\t\timport json\n",
    "\t\tproduct_info = json.loads(open(\"./5060292302201.json\").read())\n",
    "\t```\n",

    "\tYou can find the product ID for the sample item like this:  \n",
    "\t```python\n",
    "\t\tproduct_id = product_info['code']\n",
    "\t```\n",
    "\tThis will return `'5060292302201'`.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Getting the Product Name:**  \n",
    "\tThe product name can be accessed using the following code:  \n",
    "\t```python\n",
    "\t\tproduct_name = product_info['product']['product_name']\n",
    "\t```\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Listing the Ingredients:**  \n",
    "\tTo get the list of ingredients for the product, use the code below:  \n",
    "\t```python\n",
    "\t\tingredients_list = product_info['product']['ingredients']\n",
    "\t```\n",
    "\tThis will return a list of dictionaries, each containing details about an ingredient. For example, the first two elements in the list look like this:\n",
